In the not so distant future, 
mankind has advanced to a state where 
complete body transplants from flesh to machine is possible. 
This allows for great increases in both 
physical and cybernetic prowess and blurring 
the lines between the two worlds. 
However, criminals can also make 
full use of such technology, 
leading to new and sometimes, 
very dangerous crimes. 
In response to such innovative new methods, 
the Japanese Government has established Section 9, 
an independently operating police unit 
which deals with such highly sensitive crimes.
A group calling themselves "The Individual Eleven" 
has begun committing acts of terror across Japan. 
While Motoko Kusanagi, Daisuke Aramaki, Batou, 
and the other members of Section 9 investigate this new menace, 
the Japanese government faces a separate crisis, 
as foreign refugees displaced by the 
Third World War seek asylum in Japan. 
In the year 2029, advances in Cybernetics 
But as the members of the special-ops team 
allow people to replace nearly all of their 
body parts and organs with robotics. 
Through these prosthetics, 
the weak are made strong, 
continually encounter Gouda Kazundo—a 
and the dying are given new life. 
Public Security Section 9 of Niihama City 
leading member of the Cabinet Intelligence 
(a fictional setting inspired by Hong Kong), 
Service—in their hunt, 
a diverse team of AI, 
they begin to suspect that he may be involved, 
cyborgs and unmodified humans, 
and that the events of the refugee crisis 
must investigate cases of 
and The Individual Eleven may be more connected than they realize...
corruption and terrorism. 
Major Motoko Kusanagi has full-body prosthetics, 
owing to a childhood accident. 
She, her second in command Batou and 
information specialist Ishikawa 
have been assigned an important task: 
to investigate a hacker known only as 
"The Puppetmaster." 
But as Motoko and her team discover, 
things are never so simple.
