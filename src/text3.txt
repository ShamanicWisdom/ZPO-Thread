In the year 2029, advances in Cybernetics 
allow people to replace nearly all of their 
body parts and organs with robotics. 
Through these prosthetics, 
the weak are made strong, 
and the dying are given new life. 
Public Security Section 9 of Niihama City 
(a fictional setting inspired by Hong Kong), 
a diverse team of AI, 
cyborgs and unmodified humans, 
must investigate cases of 
corruption and terrorism. 
Major Motoko Kusanagi has full-body prosthetics, 
owing to a childhood accident. 
She, her second in command Batou and 
information specialist Ishikawa 
have been assigned an important task: 
to investigate a hacker known only as 
"The Puppetmaster." 
But as Motoko and her team discover, 
things are never so simple.
