In the not so distant future, 
mankind has advanced to a state where 
complete body transplants from flesh to machine is possible. 
This allows for great increases in both 
physical and cybernetic prowess and blurring 
the lines between the two worlds. 
However, criminals can also make 
full use of such technology, 
leading to new and sometimes, 
very dangerous crimes. 
In response to such innovative new methods, 
the Japanese Government has established Section 9, 
an independently operating police unit 
which deals with such highly sensitive crimes.
